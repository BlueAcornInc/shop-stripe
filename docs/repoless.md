# Repoless Configurations


## Why Go Repoless

It allows us to segment content and all that so brands see no overlap, but we can centeralize to one or two code repos

## Structure

* blueacorn.shop 
    * stripe.blueacorn.shop or stripe domain
    * adyen.blueacorn.shop or /adyen or adyen domain (but how would we use the other repo template? - point to a different code repo? Maybe this gets a blueacorn.shop/adyen in BA colors?)
    * <app>.blueacorn.shop for any standalone demo we want to present, same code repo but different content repos
